## Overview




### What is Plogging?
Plogging is a combination of "jogging" and the Swedish word "plocka upp", which means "to pick up."

> Plogging = jogging + plocka upp

In simple terms, plogging is an eco-friendly fitness activity where people pick up litter while jogging.

</br>

### Then, What is `Ploop` App?


Ploop is a mobile app designed to make plogging ‚Äî the act of picking up litter while jogging ‚Äî more accessible, purposeful, and fun.

In cities like Seoul, littering remains a social crisis, not only because of the growing volume of waste, but because it often goes unmonitored. Despite rising awareness around sustainability, daily habits are hard to change, and public systems can‚Äôt always keep up.

**Ploop aims to bridge that gap through simple, individual action.**

By turning everyday walks into missions, encouraging photo-based litter reports, and tracking activity with real-time maps and data, Ploop empowers users to make a measurable impact in their local communities.

Whether you‚Äôre walking alone or contributing to global routes, Ploop helps you visualize your actions, stay motivated, and be part of a wider movement‚Äîone walk at a time.

**Pick, Plog, and Keep the Loop Going.**

### Goal
Ploop‚Äôs goal is to transform the way individuals engage with environmental action‚Äîmaking it **part of their everyday routines**, not just occasional events.

Specifically, we aim to:
- üåç Encourage sustainable habits by turning walking or jogging into opportunities for litter cleanup

- ü§ù Encourage shared engagement through weekly partner missions and globally visible routes

- üìä Generate meaningful data on litter patterns that can inform local policies and urban planning

- üì± Make environmental contribution fun, accessible, and measurable through technology

- üîÅ Create a self-sustaining cycle of small actions that lead to long-term impact

With Ploop, we‚Äôre not just cleaning up trash‚Äîwe‚Äôre building a culture of continuous environmental awareness and action

## AI
### Trash detection
We used YOLOv11 to detect trash real-time. YOLOv11 is the latest version in the Ultralytics YOLO series, achieving breakthroughs in accuracy, speed, and efficiency in the field of real-time object detection.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3956e647-8a10-42df-8314-31228bcce173)
<br/>
Since we expected users to take photos of trash outdoors, we selected a dataset that accurately reflects such outdoor environments. Transfer learning was performed on [trash detection dataset (TACO)](https://universe.roboflow.com/ptit-rbnp6/trash-detect-taco/dataset/2), and the resulting model was deployed as an API service using FastAPI on Google Cloud. You can see our model being used when [verifying missions](#weekly_missions). 

### Team Matching
Another way of using ai was in Team Matching in Missions. Text data from users was processed using PyTorch-powered sentence embeddings via SentenceTransformers, enabling us to compute semantic similarity across user motivations and behaviors. This allowed us to match users with others who share similar goals or engagement styles. Pinecone was used as our vector database for efficient real-time similarity search. <br/>

### Plogging
![plogging](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e36f39c-40c6-4d33-90f2-ecef92b482f6)

- Ploop is designed to track your realtime activity, simple and efficiently.  
To track it more efficiently, please allow Ploop to access your location services.  

<br/>

### Map Components
![segment-filter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaaaf192-0761-4c91-970f-c59daf3cbc1a)

- Ploop uses Google Maps API to display areas reported as heavily littered or locations of nearby trash bins.  
Based on this data, Ploop recommends a daily plogging route tailored to your surroundings.  
Start plogging with a motivational message powered by Gemini!  

<br/>

### Uploading litter area & trach bin
![map-integration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77aa0f34-e98b-4664-a411-0320f577efe5)

- To report a littered area or a trash bin, simply open the camera on the map and take a photo.  
The location will be automatically uploaded to the server.  
All you need to do is specify whether you found litter or a bin.

<br/>

### Global Routes
![world](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/731eed8e-b6e5-4dd4-875b-abc692f2019a)

- No manual uploads needed ‚Äî explore the world and trace other users' footprints.
Others might even follow your plogging route, too.

<br/>
