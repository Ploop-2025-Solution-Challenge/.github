## Overview




### What is Plogging?
Plogging is a combination of "jogging" and the Swedish word "plocka upp", which means "to pick up."

> Plogging = jogging + plocka upp

In simple terms, plogging is an eco-friendly fitness activity where people pick up litter while jogging.

</br>

### Then, What is `Ploop` App?


Ploop is a mobile app designed to make plogging ‚Äî the act of picking up litter while jogging ‚Äî more accessible, purposeful, and fun.

In cities like Seoul, littering remains a social crisis, not only because of the growing volume of waste, but because it often goes unmonitored. Despite rising awareness around sustainability, daily habits are hard to change, and public systems can‚Äôt always keep up.

**Ploop aims to bridge that gap through simple, individual action.**

By turning everyday walks into missions, encouraging photo-based litter reports, and tracking activity with real-time maps and data, Ploop empowers users to make a measurable impact in their local communities.

Whether you‚Äôre walking alone or contributing to global routes, Ploop helps you visualize your actions, stay motivated, and be part of a wider movement‚Äîone walk at a time.

**Pick, Plog, and Keep the Loop Going.**

### Goal
Ploop‚Äôs goal is to transform the way individuals engage with environmental action‚Äîmaking it **part of their everyday routines**, not just occasional events.

Specifically, we aim to:
- üåç Encourage sustainable habits by turning walking or jogging into opportunities for litter cleanup

- ü§ù Encourage shared engagement through weekly partner missions and globally visible routes

- üìä Generate meaningful data on litter patterns that can inform local policies and urban planning

- üì± Make environmental contribution fun, accessible, and measurable through technology

- üîÅ Create a self-sustaining cycle of small actions that lead to long-term impact

With Ploop, we‚Äôre not just cleaning up trash‚Äîwe‚Äôre building a culture of continuous environmental awareness and action

## AI
### Trash detection
For image recognition to [verify missions](#weekly_missions), we used the **GPT-4o model** via the **OpenAI API**. This model was chosen for its excellent performance and favorable token cost.</br>
Below are the image recognition results using the GPT-4o API, which allows users to complete missions more conveniently with the help of AI.</br>

### Route Suggestion

To offer the most efficient running routes, we've combined the **Google Maps Route API** with the **K-means Clustering** algorithm. </br>
This approach generates optimal paths by considering a user's current location, as well as the locations of trash spots and nearby bins. This helps users collect trash along a predefined, convenient route.</br>
</br>
While this system provides a powerful solution for route optimization, it's important to note a current limitation: the Google Maps Route API does not support walking directions in South Korea (due to national security restrictions). </br>
We explored various alternative APIs, but other available APIs in Korea did not provide walking route functionality. As a result, this feature, while effective in other areas, is currently unavailable for users in South Korea.

### Team Matching
Another way of using AI was in Team Matching for missions.</br>

To pair users with similar interests and motivations, we utilized Sentence-Transformers to generate sentence embeddings from user text data. By calculating the cosine similarity between these embeddings, we could efficiently find and match users who share similar goals and engagement styles.</br>

For development efficiency, we directly accessed user data from a MySQL backend. To ensure the project's scalability and enable efficient, real-time similarity searches, we established a vector database using Pinecone.</br>
We are currently storing user information in Pinecone DB, but we are not utilizing it yet. We can improve this aspect later, as the user base grows, to enhance the project's scalability and enable efficient, fast similarity searches. </br> Since the user base is currently small, we have scheduled the matching system to run at a specific time.</br>
This setup allows us to find ideal partners for each user, making the mission experience more collaborative and engaging.</br>

Based on this data, Ploop recommends a daily plogging route tailored to your surroundings.  
Start plogging with AI-based recommended route!

<br/>

### Uploading litter area & trach bin
![map-integration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77aa0f34-e98b-4664-a411-0320f577efe5)

- To report a littered area or a trash bin, simply open the camera on the map and take a photo.
